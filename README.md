# Flight Booking System

A console-based flight booking system written in C++, demonstrating object-oriented design, polymorphic passenger types, file persistence, and clean class separation.

## Overview

The system manages flights, passengers, and bookings through a menu-driven interface. Passenger data and bookings are persisted to disk across sessions.

**Key design patterns used:**
- Polymorphism via abstract `Passenger` base class with `Economy` and `Business` subtypes
- Composition: `Booking` holds a `unique_ptr<Passenger>` and a `Flight`
- Single-responsibility: `System` acts as the service/orchestration layer
- File persistence: bookings serialised to `bookings.txt` on shutdown and restored on startup

## Features

- List all available flights
- Book a flight (Economy or Business class)
- View, search, and delete bookings
- Search passengers by name or SSN
- Data persisted to file between sessions

## Build

### Requirements

- C++17 compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.15+

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamad-Za/Flight-booking-system-c-.git
cd Flight-booking-system-c-
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/FlightBookingSystem
```

> **Note:** `flights.txt` must be present in the working directory when running the executable. A sample file is included in the repo root.

### Windows (Visual Studio)

Open the folder in Visual Studio 2019+ and use the built-in CMake support, or run the cmake commands above from a Developer Command Prompt.

## Data File Format

`flights.txt` - one flight per line, format: `<flight_number> <destination>`

```

```

`bookings.txt` - serialised by `System::writeAllBookingsToFile()`. Regenerated on each run.
